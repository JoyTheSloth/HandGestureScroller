# HandGestureScroller

HandGestureScroller is a Python-based application that allows users to control scrolling and interact with their computer using hand gestures. This project leverages computer vision techniques to enable intuitive user interface control through real-time hand tracking.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition**: Detect and recognize various hand gestures for scrolling actions.
- **User Interface**: A simple GUI to interact with the application.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Utilize computer vision for real-time hand tracking and gesture interpretation.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Computer Vision Libraries**: OpenCV or MediaPipe (specify which one you are using)
- **GUI Framework**: (Specify the framework used, e.g., Tkinter, PyQt)
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt` for a list of required packages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoyTheSloth/HandGestureScroller.git
   cd HandGestureScroller
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
Make sure your camera is accessible, as the application utilizes it for hand gesture detection.
